# color-maze-project
A WIP rouge-like game where the player travels through a maze/dungeon collecting pieces of color.

Story: The bad guy (thinking evil wizard type or somethinhg) has stolen color from the world. By using dark magics the bad guy is harnessing the power of color for his nefarious purposes (whatever those may be). Our hero (the player) has found the bad guy's lair and is infiltrating it, collecting Shards of Color and placing them into the Color Wheel. Each Color Shard added to the Color Wheel brings a little bit of that color back to the world. Our hero must be careful though, should the bad guy's magical constructs, the Color Gaurd, catch sight of the hero, they will give chase. Should the unthinkable happen and our hero be captured by any member of the Color Gaurd, all hope will be lost.

Controls: Thinking WASD for movement, maybe Arrow Keys. Possibly both?
